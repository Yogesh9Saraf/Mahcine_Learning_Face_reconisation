The Jupyter Notebook appears to contain a project on face recognition using deep learning. Here's a detailed description suitable for a GitHub repository:

---# Face Recognition Mini Project

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based approach for face recognition using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately identify faces from a given dataset.

## Project Overview

Face recognition is a popular application of computer vision, which involves identifying and verifying individuals from images or videos. This project leverages a CNN to perform this task, utilizing a dataset of face images for training and testing.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to normalize the images and prepare them for training.
- **Model Architecture:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed with several layers including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Training:** The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset, optimizing for accuracy and minimizing loss.
- **Evaluation:** The performance of the model is evaluated on a test set, and metrics such as accuracy and loss are plotted.
- **Face Recognition:** The trained model is used to recognize faces from new images.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to normalize and augment the dataset.
- **Model Definition:** Construction of the CNN model.
- **Training:** Training the model with the dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Plotting accuracy and loss over training epochs.
- **Prediction:** Using the trained model for face recognition on new images.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
